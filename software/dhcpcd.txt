Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Client Daemon is a popular DHCP client 
capable of handling both IPv4 and IPv6 configuration.


Dynamic IP Configuration
________________________________________________________________________________

Begin by first verifying that you have dhcpcd installed:

$ kiss b dhcpcd && kiss i dhcpcd

Once installed, dhcpcd can be used to automatically configure a network device
interface:

$ dhcpcd INTERFACE

Remember to replace INTERFACE in the command above with the name of the device 
that you wish to configure.

A network device's interface status can be inspected via ip-link:

$ ip link show dev INTERFACE

ip-link can also be used to enable or disable an interface:

$ ip link set INTERFACE down  # disables the interface
$ ip link set INTERFACE up    # enables the interface


Static IP Configuration
________________________________________________________________________________

Continuing from the previous section, we can use ip-address to display the 
current DHCP address information:

$ ip address show

Using the output of the previous command, add the following lines to the 
/etc/dhcpcd.conf file using your preferred text editor:

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                              |
|   interface INTERFACE                                                        |
|   static ip_address=STATIC_IP                                                |
|   static routers=GATEWAY                                                     |
|   static domain_name_servers=DNS_SERVER                                      |
|                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Remember to replace the INTERFACE, STATIC_IP, GATEWAY and DNS_SERVER in the
block above with your own parameters. 


Hostname
________________________________________________________________________________

A system's hostname can be set by simply creating a /etc/hostname file:

$ echo "HOSTNAME" > /etc/hostname

Remember to replace HOSTNAME with the string of your choosing.  

Note: Valid characters for hostnames include ASCII letters from A to Z, digits 
      from 0 to 9, and the hyphen character (-). A hostname may not start with 
      a hyphen.


Managed via runsv
________________________________________________________________________________

Busybox's runsv can be used to create a new managed service with the following 
command:

$ ln -s /etc/sv/dhcpcd/ /var/service

To start the new managed service, use the following command: 

$ sv up dhcpcd


Tips and Tricks
________________________________________________________________________________

* A list of possible INTERFACE names can be obtained by running the following:

  $ ls /sys/class/net
  
* The ping command can be used to verify connectivity with a network device 
  interface:
  
  $ ping www.google.com

* Some network administrators require that the hostname and domain name provided
  by the DHCP server is used by the system. In that case, pass the "-HD" switch:
  
  $ dhcpcd -HD INTERFACE

* If you are not sure what to put in the STATIC_IP, GATEWAY and DNS_SERVER, you
  can use the following example for reference:
  
  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  |                                                                            |
  |   interface eth0                                                           |
  |   static ip_address=192.168.0.4/24                                         |
  |   static routers=192.168.0.1                                               |
  |   static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1                                   |
  |                                                                            |
  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  Notice the "/24" suffix, which is an abbreviation for the subnet mask 
  255.255.255.0. Also, GATEWAY and DNS_SERVER are the same in this example.
