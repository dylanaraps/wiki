BUSYBOX [0]
________________________________________________________________________________

BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small 
executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of the utilities you 
usually find in GNU coreutils, util-linux, etc. The utilities in BusyBox 
generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the 
options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave very
much like their GNU counterparts.

This page is not intended toi be a complete explanation of all BusyBox utilites,
but rather provide supplimental material and references to pages for common
configuration activites.
	

[1.0] Inittab
________________________________________________________________________________

The inittab file describes which processes are started at bootup and during 
normal operation (e.g. /etc/init.d/boot, /etc/init.d/rc, gettys...). Init 
distinguishes multiple runlevels, each of which can have its own set of 
processes that are started. Valid runlevels are 0âˆ’6 plus A, B, and C for 
on-demand entries. [1]
