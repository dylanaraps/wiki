XORG-SERVER [0]
________________________________________________________________________________

The xorg-server, part of the X.Org releases, is the main component of the X 
Window system which abstracts the hardware and provides the foundation for most 
graphical user interfaces, like desktop environments or window managers, and 
their applications.


Getting Started
________________________________________________________________________________

If you are following along from the KISS installation guide, you should already
have the following packages installed:

* xorg-server
* xf86-input-libinput
* liberation-fonts (optional)

In order to start the X window system server, you will also need to install
and configure _ONE_ of the following packages:

* xinit (@/xorg/xinit)
* sx (@/xorg/sx)


Graphics Drivers
________________________________________________________________________________

Depending on your graphics card hardware, one of the following graphics card 
packages should also be installed:

* xf86-video-amdgpu
* xf86-video-ati
* xf86-video-intel
* xf86-video-nouveau
* xf86-video-vesa

Note: xf86-video-intel is not needed for Intel GPUs as the generic modesetting 
      driver built into Xorg works really well.


Window Managers
________________________________________________________________________________

Note: Installing a window manager is entirely optional and based on user 
      preference.

A window manager (WM) is system software that controls the placement and 
appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface. 
There are many great WM solutions available for KISS, most of which have been 
contributed by individuals via the Community repository. 

The following is a snapshot of some of the available WMs at this time:

+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
|   Window Manager   |   Description                                           |

|   2bwm             |   A fast floating WM, with the particularity of         |
|                    |   having 2 borders, written over the XCB library and    |
|                    |   derived from mcwm written by Michael Cardell. [1]     |
|                    |                                                         |
|   bspwm            |   bspwm is a tiling window manager that represents      |
|                    |   windows as the leaves of a full binary tree. [2]      |
|                    |                                                         |
|   dwm              |   dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages     |
|                    |   windows in tiled, monocle and floating layouts. All   |
|                    |   of the layouts can be applied dynamically,            |
|                    |   optimising the environment for the application in     |
|                    |   use and the task performed. [3]                       |

Remote X Session Management
________________________________________________________________________________

What if you need to access your applications remotely?  The solution is to 
utilize X server's "baked in" X11 forwarding solution.  For for more information, 
check out the @/xorg/x11-forwarding article.
